In October, I responded to Reboot&amp;rsquo;s manifesto, ‚ÄúTake Back the Future.‚Äù, which calls upon technologists to pursue and leverage their unique agency in shaping technology, which has an outsized impact on the future of our livelihoods, to advocate for the people who have less agency and push for a brighter, more equal future.

Personality types are an interesting way we use to pretend to be in control of the world and knowing of the world&amp;rsquo;s secrets. We bucket each other into divisions of 16 and 9 and 25 and 12, assigning occupations and strengths, disposition and spirit animals. We tend to like hard divides because they give us the illusion of truth.</description></item><item><title>re: take back the future - the magic is ours</title><link>https://www.spencerchang.me/posts/take-back-the-future-response/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spencerchang.me/posts/take-back-the-future-response/</guid><description>In response to take back the future
In high school, I took a computer science class because I liked to play computer games. I never intended for it to become an outlet for expression, a STEM safe haven for my creative urges. I fell for the craft as much as I fell for the people and brands that were the face of it in society.
I&amp;rsquo;m heavily drawn to ideals, so nothing drew me more than the shining G, which had started to become the face of everyone&amp;rsquo;s experience with the internet.</description></item><item><title>Liminal Illusions</title><link>https://www.spencerchang.me/posts/liminal-illusions/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 Aug 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spencerchang.me/posts/liminal-illusions/</guid><description>This is a collage of several journals (composed at various levels of drunkenness) over the past weekend in Vegas, and my post-trip reflections from immersing myself in that environment.
Liminality is defined as the quality of transition between one destination and the next. It‚Äôs a state of being that feels unnatural because it‚Äôs meant to be temporary. Liminal states and places are defined only by their beginning and end‚Äîthey have no meaning in absence of their composite destinations.</description></item><item><title>denim personality</title><link>https://www.spencerchang.me/posts/denim-personality/</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 Aug 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spencerchang.me/posts/denim-personality/</guid><description>I‚Äôve been getting really into fashion lately. Perhaps my visit to New York was what really kicked it into overdrive for me given the opportunity to get inspiration everywhere you go on the street, but I‚Äôve always been enamored with the idea of fashion and making yourself look good to feel good. As a child, I was bold with my choices. According to my dad who resurfaced an old journal entry recently, I once tried on some shoes in a store and refused to take them off because I was so enamored with them, and my parents ended up having to buy this nice pair of shoes for a 5-year-old (what a difficult child I must have been üòÖ).</description></item><item><title>the technology paradox</title><link>https://www.spencerchang.me/posts/technology-paradox/</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jul 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spencerchang.me/posts/technology-paradox/</guid><description>Under 280 in San Francisco during golden hour.
Yesterday, I made the trek down to Palo Alto for Alex&amp;rsquo;s birthday and had a great time in the afternoon barbecuing, laughing, and enjoying the South Bay summer. I was realizing it was the first time in the Bay where I&amp;rsquo;ve attended a large gathering that wasn&amp;rsquo;t predominantly people in the tech industry.

I&amp;rsquo;ve found myself catching myself from thinking too quickly recently, the thoughts tumbling over each other and jostling for the room to breathe. Sometimes my mind feels like a bumping nightclub in the rush of the night&amp;mdash;overwhelming sights and sounds fighting for your attention. The game is one of being more attractive, more provocative, more desirable than all the others, and the battleground is our senses.</description></item><item><title>commitment and obligation</title><link>https://www.spencerchang.me/posts/commitment-and-obligation/</link><pubDate>Sun, 23 May 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spencerchang.me/posts/commitment-and-obligation/</guid><description>The first time I ran 3 miles was during a typical Houston summer, hot and humid. It was just past one, past the hottest time of day but still above 90, still hot enough to see the light shimmering in the liminal space between the planes where your eyes focused.

I‚Äôm nearing the end of my first year in college, and having been successful at my quest to fit in, I‚Äôm tempted to change as little as possible to keep the good things going.

Thick layers of shadows pile on top of one another until all that‚Äôs left poking out in the sea of night are tiny fireflies, little torches signaling life. I look out my golden-ratioed window, a precise, technical masterpiece with a reinforced panel of glass acting as a projector for the production playing out beyond. In the distant horizon, the line where the sky meets the world and the galactic bend, glinting ever so inconspicuously, levels with my eyes.</description></item><item><title>Making the World a Better Place: A Valley of Smoke and Mirrors</title><link>https://www.spencerchang.me/posts/better-world-delusion/</link><pubDate>Sat, 26 Sep 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spencerchang.me/posts/better-world-delusion/</guid><description>a beach along Route 1 covered by the fog (photo credit spencerchang.photography)
To communicate an identity requires some degree of self-delusion. A performer, in order to be convincing, must conceal ‚Äúthe discreditable facts that he has had to learn about the performance; in everyday terms, there will be things he knows, or has known, that he will not be able to tell himself.‚Äù „Éº Trick Mirror: Reflections on Self-Delusion by Jia Tolentino summarizing Erving Goffman In second grade, we did an assignment on our dream jobs.</description></item><item><title>Making the ‚ÄúRight‚Äù Decisions</title><link>https://www.spencerchang.me/posts/right-decisions/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Jul 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spencerchang.me/posts/right-decisions/</guid><description>A mother and cub flourishing in the remains of a whaling station in Grytviken&amp;ndash;an example of something &amp;ldquo;right&amp;rdquo; becoming wrong.

Growing up, I strove to do all the ‚Äúright‚Äù things. I was told that doing well in school was good, so I studied, toiled, and recited for good grades.

But in a life of activity, one free from dramatic rupture, where the progress of things is unbroken by catastrophe, where the skin of our thoughts is regularly touched by new impressions, discoveries and influences, our maturation comes to follow a gradient that creates the illusion of a seamless line. With Uncle Hmad, the young man he was at the point of his arrest and the man he has become seemed to exist in parallel, destined never to meet and yet resonating against one another like two discordant musical notes.</description></item><item><title>a twinkle</title><link>https://www.spencerchang.me/posts/a-twinkle/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spencerchang.me/posts/a-twinkle/</guid><description>A shaft of moonlight pierces the curtain
In my concrete abode, a flare lighting the way out
The ephemeral promise draws me
like a firefly I seek my hopes.
The defeaning chorus of cicadas
consumes me in the darkness.
Out in the fields, the grains cultivated
What was promised eclipses the night
A permanent night light bathes me
as the swarm of stars engulfs me
from the infinite black canvas above</description></item><item><title>Crowdsourced Birthday Recommendations</title><link>https://www.spencerchang.me/posts/crowdsourced-birthday-recs/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spencerchang.me/posts/crowdsourced-birthday-recs/</guid><description>I collected anonymous (or not) birthday recommendations and feedback.

We had just gotten back from the movies, and I was going through the regular ritual of preparing for my nightly recharge. The room was pitch dark except for the flickering amalgam of multicolored lights dancing across the window: reflections mirroring the revelry of a city alive at night.
