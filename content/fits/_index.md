This project started off with me wanting some way to document a new intention to try new outfits every day, so I kicked off a [twitter thread](https://twitter.com/spencerc99/status/1421244720638873603?s=21) and was on my way. However, I soon found it difficult to constantly keep it updated. I wanted somewhere permanent to continually reference back to a growing collection, and I wanted to keep it lightweight for documenting, so that the documentation wouldn't feel like a chore.

I ended up creating an automated process for taking my fit of the day, uploading it to cloud storage, and serving that and the relevant metadata on my website. Now I can just tell anyone to go to the fits tab on my website to see some examples, and the best part is that it'll stay updated live with minimal effort. 

If you're wondering why I'm going to all this effort or why I care about fashion, I've written about that in [denim personality](/newsletter/denim-personality) and [this piece](https://reallifemag.com/worn-out/) in Real Life Mag gets at why it's important.


And without further ado, here are my fits! I share for the feedback and resonance with people, so feel free to [let me know](/#:~:text=Say%20hi%20%F0%9F%91%8B%20(Twitter%2C%20email)) if any of them are particularly appealing or interesting :)
