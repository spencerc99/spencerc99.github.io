This project started with finding a way to document my intention to try new outfits every day. I ended up kicking off a [twitter thread](https://twitter.com/spencerc99/status/1421244720638873603?s=21) but soon found it difficult to keep it updated. It was too heavy of an action, but I still wanted somewhere permanent to reference my growing collection. At the same time, I wanted to keep it lightweight for documenting to avoid making dressing up feel like a chore.

So, I created an automated process for taking my fit of the day, uploading it to cloud storage, and seving all of the data on my website. Now I can just tell anyone to go to the fits tab on my website, and the best part is that it'll stay updated live with minimal effort. Full breakdown to come ðŸ˜‰

I've written about why I'm going to all this effort and why I care about fashion in [denim personality](/newsletter/denim-personality) and [this piece](https://reallifemag.com/worn-out/) in Real Life Mag gets at why it's important.


And without further ado, here are my fits! I share for the feedback and resonance with people, so please [let me know](/#:~:text=Say%20hi%20%F0%9F%91%8B%20(Twitter%2C%20email)) if any of them are particularly appealing or interesting!
