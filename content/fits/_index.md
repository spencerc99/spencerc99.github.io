This project started with finding a way to document my intention to try new outfits every day. I ended up kicking off a [twitter thread](https://twitter.com/spencerc99/status/1421244720638873603?s=21) but soon found it difficult to keep it updated. I wanted somewhere permanent to reference my growing collection and have a lightweight action to document it to avoid making dressing up feel like a chore.

So, I created an automated process for taking my fit of the day, uploading it to cloud storage, and serving the photos from my website. Now I can just tell anyone to go to the fits tab on my website, and the best part is that it'll stay updated live with minimal effort.

I've written about why I'm going to all this effort and why I care about fashion in [denim personality](/posts/denim-personality) and [this piece](https://reallifemag.com/worn-out/) in Real Life Mag gets at why it's important.
