Found some inspiring poetry lately so will be forcing myself to do more in the next couple weeks :)

"One's true character shows
when the storm comes knocking,
when they're pressed to a wall,
or caught by a trap.
When plans fall through
and dangers come to rest,
the act falls away,
the heart's all that's left.

We long for heroes
in our life of normals.
We yearn for the extraordinary
to save us from quarrels.
We pray for our dreams
and our forgiveness too
to gain what we wish for
and lament what we rue.
We think we need saving
from our own trials.
I think we need a reminder
of what's under the denial.

You have what it takes
to do all you want
to get all you need
to reach all you seek.
Remember your beating heart
when the shaking starts;
just burn away the haze
and set your heart ablaze"
