On April 9, 2021, when I turned 24, I started an experiment to write and publish 100 mini-essays by the end of August by trying to publish something (almost) every day. Mini-essays meaning they concisely demonstrate a single principle and are lightly edited (if at all). 

My goal for them is to be a forcing function for me to distill the ideas with some substance that I think about each day into a publicly digestible form, but not edited or polished enough to become a full-blown blog post to retain some of that rawness and decrease the barrier to releasing it into the digital ether. I was also inspired by [visakanv's](https://twitter.com/visakanv) "do 100 things" principle and the [#30for30](https://ship30for30.com/) movement to continually produce and make things. I've been doing this in private with my [live monitor habit tracker](https://coda.io/@spencer/decoding-your-mind/live-spencer-monitor-22) but decided that creating a public artifact is better for creating [learning exhaust](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public/). I want to be fairly regimented about getting 100 of these things out but don't want to force myself to the point that it feels like a chore and I lose the joy of creating them. With that perspective in mind, I'd like to have 100 artifacts by the end of August.
