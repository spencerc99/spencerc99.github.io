a couple poems on this rainy SF day.
### pitter patter
pitter patter
the droplets race
pitter patter
the ground laced
pitter patter
the humans hide
pitter patter
as the oceans stride

### nothing to see
tingling fingers,
pinching innards
disconnect feelings
and entangle urges

trying to run
begets walking;
trying to sing
begets croaking
willing to be
leaves nothing to see.
