Trust yourself when the weather turns.
Press forward even as cloudy omens loom.
Have conviction especially as the arrows eclipse the sky.

When Danger approaches, 
Wrap yourself in Conviction to 
Ward away the evil.

Impish whispers urge quitting.
Steel your heart with your cowardice—
Fear: perfect for hardening resolve.
