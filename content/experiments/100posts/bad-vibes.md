some notes on a realization on bad vibes today and how the opposite is like infinite energy:

seamless and fun collaboration can fuel you forever. my mantra is building cool shit with amazing people. that's the dream
* you can be a nice guy while not understanding the vibes
	* some people are used to things going a certain way so they never encounter bad vibes because it's a foreign concept to them (related piece on [acclimating to power](/experiments/100posts/power-acclimation)). Bad vibes is a learned thing when things in life don't go the "happy path" that is expected.
	* related to ava's eternal question [around self help](https://ava.substack.com/p/is-self-help-bad)
		* paradox between people saying “its all in your hands” but they actually had to do comparatively little work given their status in life
			* paradox between advice on effort and lived experience
	* not that people have never encountered failure, they just never encountered the bad vibes. Normal hardship is different from the invisible incidental hardship...
		* like it needs to distinguish normal hardship (I have to do well in school, I have to work hard for my dreams, etc. And the invisible/incidental hardship (Im a minority trying to break into this field, i lack a stable social safety net…?,….etc>? )
	* empathy is understanding that different hardships are experienced differently and  there are not well defined relations amongst all of them.
