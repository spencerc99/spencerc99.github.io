Life is fragile is a message from Sex Education (fire tv show btw).

The main message is to live for the day because from the hour youâ€™re born you begin to die. Another flavor of live to minimize regrets. We have such limited time on the planet. Don't waste it on people or things that don't make you happy or don't care about you, and cherish the people and things who do because losing them will be incredibly hard.

heard this in Sex Education after the class visits an old WWII cemetery / battleground, and one of the students is especially affected by the experience.
