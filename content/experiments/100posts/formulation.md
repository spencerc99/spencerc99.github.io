I've been really loving George Saunders recently, and I ran into this interview with him and now love him even more because of his perspective:
* > I don’t know that it [the ending] was the right one. But I think it was the most interesting one. That’s a funny thing about writing stories. We have that illusion that we are “deciding” what to make a character do, in order to “convey our message” or something like that. But, at least in my experience, <mark>you are often more like a river-rafting guide who’s been paid a bonus to purposely steer your clients into the roughest possible water</mark>
* > And as a fiction writer, I pretty much say: <mark>Well, my job is to make what happens within the story convincing and accurate and compelling and believable – and if I am a decent observer of human nature and the world, all theological ideas can find a home here.</mark> That is: if I make a good simulacrum, it will accommodate many ways of conceptual thinking.
* > <mark>is fiction more useful for hard questions? Yes. Because fiction, as Chekov said, doesn’t have to solve problems, it just has to formulate them correctly. So a good story can answer “the question” in several contradictory ways, and just let those answers hang there, resonating beautifully—and that IS the (larger) answer: that field of contradictions</mark>. When we have to choose one or the other, and eradicate the other truths, then we start making mistakes. My sense is, the longer we can abide in a space of not-knowing—or letting the many truths hang there—the better off we are. If, eventually, we have to act (as, of course, we sometimes do) that action will be a better action for the longer period of waiting-to-act. The longer we abide in ambiguity, the wiser we get.
