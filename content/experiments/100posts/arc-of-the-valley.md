Arc of the valley from Rick, basically the hero's journey but in silicon valley
1. Bright eyed on the ideals and optimism
2. Disillusionment encountered at the dissonance 
3. Deep disillusionment, cynical about everything
4. Matured state of making a difference where you can in your realm of control. Leaving the playground better than you found it

The true cynicism comes from dealing with nasty people and artificial problems and finding out that a lot of the promises made around social good are empty. The one redeeming factor is the amazing people you get to work with. That's the magic that you can find and seek out.
