Postal Portals is a new series of letters between myself and friends, intended to serve as a long-form medium to deep-dive into a snapshot of each otherâ€™s thoughts and emotions in an asynchronous manner. Often, when we catch up with close friends we havenâ€™t seen in a while, thereâ€™s a lot of tangible ground to cover (physical events that happened, the progression of life, etc.) which doesnâ€™t touch as much on the emotional and mental states we occupied and shifted from. These postal portals provide a gateway for the world to an excavation site of those internal states. This was inspired by [The W Letters](https://medium.com/the-w-letters) that my friend Jamie curates, so if this sort of thing interests you, go check that out too!
