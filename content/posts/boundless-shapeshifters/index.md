You might be wondering... What is this? This is a telescopic poem, a form of software poetics that I'm fascinated with. I'm excited about the [potential of shapeshifting text](https://twitter.com/spencerc99/status/1493435055225643015?s=20&t=vwAEdDf4rtBtArHNUOcjPg) that software offers us. Test out and make your own on the [test bed](https://poems.verses.xyz/test) or read more about it in my [newsletter issue](https://spencerchang.substack.com/p/despair-and-hope).
