I collected anonymous (or not) birthday recommendations and feedback. It was amazing to hear from so many people, both close friends and acquaintances and their inner thoughts. I'm so grateful to everyone who filled it out!

It all started in a bright hospital room in downtown Houston... 

Ok maybe not that far back, but essentially I got the idea from my friend Kevin Lau who did the same thing for his birthday. I loved the idea of getting recommendations and feedback from people who know me, no matter how deeply we've interacted. It's an amazing experience to get to get a peek into someone else's head and see a piece of their perspective on the world, so thank you to everyone who helped me do so!

With ❤️
Spencer
