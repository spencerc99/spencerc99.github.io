All my public writing is here in some form. I write for emotional 
resonance, so if something I've written strikes a chord, please send me a note (<a href="https://twitter.com/@spencerc99">Twitter</a> or <a href="mailto:spencerc99@gmail.com">email</a>)

    I first caught the writing bug in third grade when I wrote a story about a wizard on a space adventure, but I treated the bug as an infection--a distraction from the “professional” classes that I needed to pursue the STEM career my parents desired for me. Math and science were to come before magical incantations and ethical dilemmas. In college, I found the freedom to explore my writing alongside my academic obligations of computer science and calculus and accounting and started a blog to share my inner thoughts with the world. Since then, I’ve continued to write on my blog (which has transformed into this website) in both reflective posts, argumentative essays, and short flash-like fiction and maintain a personal <a href="https://spencerchang.substack.com/">newsletter</a> where I share thoughts and updates and personal essays.

    <p>I end up setting aside time every day before I start work to write and explore and sometimes find myself seized with bursts of inspiration that I must empty onto paper in the early morning hours. I rigorously give myself space to write even though I’m primarily a writer of passion because writing is how I think, explore, and dream. It’s my submarine to probe into the depths of my subconscious and excavate those submerged emotions and cravings. It’s my limitless blank canvas, where I can freely shape rules and assumptions as I please to convey a feeling or traverse an experiment. It’s the portal to entirely new worlds and universes, where I can play both god, in manifesting my emotions in the literary flesh, and the background observer, in watching how the characters and systems develop naturally in that artificial environment.</p>
