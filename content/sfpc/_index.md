hi! I'm spencer. 

I'm taking the For Love and Science class because I think about approaching technology/science from community practice / traditions.

some examples of inspirations of human technology
- hands as technology
  - hands as memory
  - hands as calculator
    - counting
    - rosary for counting
  - hand as scale
- dance as technology
- chanting as technology

**about me**
<div id="expandingWork"></div>

I care about
* [communal internet dreams](https://we-b.site/)
* tools for [poetic computing](https://poems.verses.xyz/)
* [living websites](https://www.spencerchang.me/window/)

thanks for listening! while you're around, stay a while and explore my corner of the internet. I'll get the kettle brewing.
