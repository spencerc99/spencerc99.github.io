title: "Inspiration"

No personal website is an isolated project, and I'm grateful for all the brilliant people that I am able to learn from and adapt their creations for my own needs. I especially want to give space to some people who have significantly shaped the development of this website: Jacky Zhao, Jamie Wong, Jasmine Wang, Nikhil Thota.
