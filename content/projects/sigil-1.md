title: "SIGIL I"
description: |
    A ceramic charm of my personal logo derived from my Chinese name (正) with an NFC chip inside with my website written on it. I carry it whenever I go out to keep my website close, and when I meet people I can "give" them my website by tapping their phones with my stamp.

    *SIGIIL I* is an experiment in creating single-purpose objects to represent digital ones, giving them form, texture, and history.
