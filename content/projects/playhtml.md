[playhtml](https://playhtml.fun) is an [open-source library](https://github.com/spencerc99/playhtml) for designing communal internet experiences by enhancing web elements with real-time, collaborative interactivity.

This project started out as a way to explore how I could make collective interactive design more accessible to people who just know basic HTML and CSS and create weird, personal internet sites (see [html.energy](https://html.energy/)). In [(we)bsite](https://we-b.site/), we tried out a lot of new interaction mechanisms for collective space-making but it involved syncing state, creating a database to store history, and handling all the nitty gritty of manipulating HTML elements.
