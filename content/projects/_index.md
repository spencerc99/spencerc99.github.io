I like to create software that is beautiful, poetic, playful, and empowering. These are some of the things I've created and tinkered on towards that end. I want software creation to feel more like [home-cooking](https://www.robinsloan.com/notes/home-cooked-app/). I want to taste software, to pass ingredients and side dishes as we pair, to make lil apps with our hodgepodge of leftovers... I'm hoping my work will forward a world that looks like that.
