Here's some of my writing on the projects I've worked on.

Some things I haven't yet written about but am proud of are:
* My [Fits Stream](/fits), an auto-stream of my daily outfits.
* [Towards a Digital Pluriverse](https://pluriverse.world): An interactive, participatory essay proposing the "pluriverse" as a new banner for the community to rally around for how we look at imagining a "new web." It is co-created with visitors and readers of the site.
