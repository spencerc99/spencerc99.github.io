title: "Gather"
description: |
  - an interface for collecting and cultivating homegrown collections (databases) that bridges the instant experience of texting yourself and the curated experience of folder organization
    - a personal discord + your assets folder
    - your text conversation with yourself + your photo albums
    - your downloads folder + your are.na
    - your camera roll + your figma moodboard
  - a client for local-first archival that works with multiple data sources
  - a social media for sharing rather than broadcasting
