For two years, I was a core engineer on [Packs](https://coda.io/packs), a platform for extending Coda's functionality by bringing in and taking action on external apps' data. I worked across the board on the [user-](https://community.coda.io/t/launched-improvements-for-copying-cross-doc-tables/23707) and [developer-facing experience](https://coda.io/packs/build/latest/tutorials/get-started/web/), platform infrastructure, and the open-source [Packs SDK](https://github.com/coda/packs-sdk). Select highlights:

-   Created [Pack Cards](https://community.coda.io/t/pack-makers-assemble-add-cards-to-your-packs/39318), a live data, customizable card for external app data.
-   Created [OpenAI Pack](https://community.coda.io/t/pack-makers-assemble-add-cards-to-your-packs/39318), an integration for everyone to leverage AI for their work and creative expression with their everyday tools.
