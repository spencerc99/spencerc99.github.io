      I spent my days building tools for tinkers at <a id="coda" href="https://coda.io">Coda</a>. I built out our <a href="/posts/rituals-remixing">custom templates platform</a> and now work on the <a href="https://coda.io/packsbeta">Packs platform</a> so that anyone can extend Coda's capabilities. I also explore soulful, speculative software poetics with <a href="https://verses.xyz" id="verses">verses</a> and recently co-stewarded the creation of <b  id="pluriverse"><a href="https://pluriverse.world">pluriverse.world</a></b>.
