          Thinking about how we can foster creative agency, encourage <a href="https://mmm.page/helena.soft_tech">soft tech</a>, form societies that put people before systems, scale trust and collaboration in our communities, and express ourselves more authentically and live more fully.

              How we can give users more agency in the software they use or are used by every day and what does a healthy relationship with <a href="/posts/technology-paradox">technology look like</a>?

        Sometimes <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/93224420-spencer-chang">reading</a>, sometimes <a href="#summaryList">writing</a>, other times taking <a href="https://www.instagram.com/spencerchang.photography/">photos</a>, and often eating.

        Working to empower people to collaborate and create at <a id="coda" href="https://coda.io">Coda</a>. I built out our <a href="/posts/rituals-remixing">custom templates platform</a> and now work on the <a href="https://coda.io/packs">Packs platform</a> so that anyone can extend Coda's capabilities.
