Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Spencer and this is my personal website built in Hugo.

I designed this site with legibility and a delightful reading experience at the forefront, and at the same time, tried to insert playful notes of personality throughout such as with the font/icon change to denote fictional works. 

I've also designed this site to be friendly to sharing and gaining traffic by ensuring unfurls and embeds grab the proper attributes as well as adding in Google Analytics.

The site is automatically deployed to "spencerchang.me" via Github Pages.

This is open source to encourage others to make and explore their own personal websites, but I'd appreciate attribution and proper credit if you use my code or designs. Thanks!

## Specifics
### Analytics
This site is set up with Google Analytics using the Hugo GA shortcode. I also augmented this with (this repo)[https://github.com/googleanalytics/autotrack] which adds additional GA tracking.
