Wow, this is the 100th mini-essay, the final of the initial intent I started out with. To be honest, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure I would make it this far, and there were definitely moments of berating myself for committing myself publicly to this experiment. I got the seed of this idea from writing a little retro for my 24th birthday, reflecting on my 2021 theme of gambling and what direction I want to take my life and where I draw energy from.</description></item><item><title>quiet confidence</title><link>https://www.spencerchang.me/experiments/100posts/quiet-confidence/</link><pubDate>Wed, 29 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spencerchang.me/experiments/100posts/quiet-confidence/</guid><description>I watched this video today after showing up on my Youtube feed and started thinking about how to exude confidence with every ounce of your being. To me, confidence has always felt like a foreign attribute and skill that I need to actively work on. I naturally caveat and hurry through and self-deprecate to serve an artificial to avoid imposing and be looked upon favorable as &amp;ldquo;what a humble guy.&amp;rdquo; It means I&amp;rsquo;ve had to learn to force myself to be confident, even aiming to be arrogant or selfish in order to actually stand up for myself and assert my ground.</description></item><item><title>Everyday Magic</title><link>https://www.spencerchang.me/posts/everyday-magic/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spencerchang.me/posts/everyday-magic/</guid><description>Isn&amp;rsquo;t it mindboggling that we created machines that can fly and swim?
In October, I responded to Reboot&amp;rsquo;s manifesto, ‚ÄúTake Back the Future.‚Äù, which calls upon technologists to pursue and leverage their unique agency in shaping technology, which has an outsized impact on the future of our livelihoods, to advocate for the people who have less agency and push for a brighter, more equal future.

In high school, I took a computer science class because I liked to play computer games. I never intended for it to become an outlet for expression, a STEM safe haven for my creative urges. I fell for the craft as much as I fell for the people and brands that were the face of it in society.
I&amp;rsquo;m heavily drawn to ideals, so nothing drew me more than the shining G, which had started to become the face of everyone&amp;rsquo;s experience with the internet.</description></item><item><title>Liminal Illusions</title><link>https://www.spencerchang.me/posts/liminal-illusions/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 Aug 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spencerchang.me/posts/liminal-illusions/</guid><description>This is a collage of several journals (composed at various levels of drunkenness) over the past weekend in Vegas, and my post-trip reflections from immersing myself in that environment.
Liminality is defined as the quality of transition between one destination and the next. It‚Äôs a state of being that feels unnatural because it‚Äôs meant to be temporary. Liminal states and places are defined only by their beginning and end‚Äîthey have no meaning in absence of their composite destinations.</description></item><item><title>liminal illusions</title><link>https://www.spencerchang.me/experiments/100posts/liminal-illusions/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 Aug 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spencerchang.me/experiments/100posts/liminal-illusions/</guid><description/></item><item><title>kindness journal</title><link>https://www.spencerchang.me/experiments/100posts/kindness-journal/</link><pubDate>Tue, 24 Aug 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spencerchang.me/experiments/100posts/kindness-journal/</guid><description/></item><item><title>denim personality</title><link>https://www.spencerchang.me/experiments/100posts/denim-personality/</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 Aug 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spencerchang.me/experiments/100posts/denim-personality/</guid><description/></item><item><title>denim personality</title><link>https://www.spencerchang.me/posts/denim-personality/</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 Aug 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spencerchang.me/posts/denim-personality/</guid><description>I‚Äôve been getting really into fashion lately. Perhaps my visit to New York was what really kicked it into overdrive for me given the opportunity to get inspiration everywhere you go on the street, but I‚Äôve always been enamored with the idea of fashion and making yourself look good to feel good. As a child, I was bold with my choices. According to my dad who resurfaced an old journal entry recently, I once tried on some shoes in a store and refused to take them off because I was so enamored with them, and my parents ended up having to buy this nice pair of shoes for a 5-year-old (what a difficult child I must have been üòÖ).</description></item><item><title>the technology paradox</title><link>https://www.spencerchang.me/posts/technology-paradox/</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jul 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spencerchang.me/posts/technology-paradox/</guid><description>Under 280 in San Francisco during golden hour.
Yesterday, I made the trek down to Palo Alto for Alex&amp;rsquo;s birthday and had a great time in the afternoon barbecuing, laughing, and enjoying the South Bay summer. I was realizing it was the first time in the Bay where I&amp;rsquo;ve attended a large gathering that wasn&amp;rsquo;t predominantly people in the tech industry. Alex is a graduate student in physics at Stanford, so the party was full of PhD candidates and high school friends who&amp;rsquo;ve covered a spread across the different fields.</description></item><item><title>uneven time</title><link>https://www.spencerchang.me/experiments/100posts/uneven-time/</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jul 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spencerchang.me/experiments/100posts/uneven-time/</guid><description/></item><item><title>uneven time</title><link>https://www.spencerchang.me/posts/uneven-time/</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jul 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spencerchang.me/posts/uneven-time/</guid><description>an art piece representing the fish of lijiang by James W Hedges
I&amp;rsquo;ve found myself catching myself from thinking too quickly recently, the thoughts tumbling over each other and jostling for the room to breathe. Sometimes my mind feels like a bumping nightclub in the rush of the night&amp;mdash;overwhelming sights and sounds fighting for your attention. The game is one of being more attractive, more provocative, more desirable than all the others, and the battleground is our senses.</description></item><item><title>a drop of color</title><link>https://www.spencerchang.me/experiments/100posts/a-drop-of-color/</link><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jul 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spencerchang.me/experiments/100posts/a-drop-of-color/</guid><description/></item><item><title>the silo culture</title><link>https://www.spencerchang.me/experiments/100posts/the-silo-culture/</link><pubDate>Thu, 03 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spencerchang.me/experiments/100posts/the-silo-culture/</guid><description/></item><item><title>commitment and obligation</title><link>https://www.spencerchang.me/posts/commitment-and-obligation/</link><pubDate>Sun, 23 May 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spencerchang.me/posts/commitment-and-obligation/</guid><description>The first time I ran 3 miles was during a typical Houston summer, hot and humid. It was just past one, past the hottest time of day but still above 90, still hot enough to see the light shimmering in the liminal space between the planes where your eyes focused. I started cross country in middle school to follow my brother‚Äôs footsteps, and I kept with it because I figured it was a good way to keep myself fit.</description></item><item><title>Rituals at Scale: How we remixed templates</title><link>https://www.spencerchang.me/posts/rituals-remixing/</link><pubDate>Thu, 13 May 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spencerchang.me/posts/rituals-remixing/</guid><description/></item><item><title>craft over career</title><link>https://www.spencerchang.me/experiments/100posts/craft-over-career/</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spencerchang.me/experiments/100posts/craft-over-career/</guid><description/></item><item><title>craft over career</title><link>https://www.spencerchang.me/posts/craft-over-career/</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spencerchang.me/posts/craft-over-career/</guid><description>This post was originally published on my newsletter.

In my concrete abode, a flare lighting the way out
The ephemeral promise draws me
like a firefly I seek my hopes.
The defeaning chorus of cicadas
consumes me in the darkness.
Out in the fields, the grains cultivated
What was promised eclipses the night
A permanent night light bathes me
as the swarm of stars engulfs me
