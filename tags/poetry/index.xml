The basic idea of the project is that anyone can find &amp;ldquo;amulets&amp;rdquo; and then optionally choose to mint them (with an additional operation required to make it &amp;ldquo;public&amp;rdquo; and a unenforceable requirement that a link to a carbon offset is also provided). These amulets are &amp;ldquo;poems&amp;rdquo; that satisfy a specific constraint, that they are under 64 bytes and the SHA-256 hex hash of the poem has four or more 8s in a row.</description></item><item><title>two toned</title><link>https://www.spencerchang.me/experiments/100posts/two-toned/</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spencerchang.me/experiments/100posts/two-toned/</guid><description>Dissonance,
uninhibited heights
cooled by night
Whispers
urgently pressed
to reconcile minds
Outbursts
Melodic giggles
chasing timeless moments
Silences
Tension dripping
Pillows smothered down
Two-toned
Tense light
tale of life.

Press forward even as cloudy omens loom.
Have conviction especially as the arrows eclipse the sky.
When Danger approaches,
Wrap yourself in Conviction to
Ward away the evil.
Impish whispers urge quitting.
Steel your heart with your cowardice—
Fear: perfect for hardening resolve.

pitter patter pitter patter
the droplets race
pitter patter
the ground laced
pitter patter
the humans hide
pitter patter
as the oceans stride
nothing to see tingling fingers,
pinching innards
disconnect feelings
and entangle urges
trying to run
begets walking;
trying to sing
begets croaking
willing to be
leaves nothing to see.

&amp;ldquo;One&amp;rsquo;s true character shows
when the storm comes knocking,
when they&amp;rsquo;re pressed to a wall,
or caught by a trap.
When plans fall through
and dangers come to rest,
the act falls away,
the heart&amp;rsquo;s all that&amp;rsquo;s left.
We long for heroes
in our life of normals.
We yearn for the extraordinary</description></item><item><title>compliments</title><link>https://www.spencerchang.me/experiments/100posts/compliments/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spencerchang.me/experiments/100posts/compliments/</guid><description>rising lights shining

high, of second sky
that idea about compliments compliments are free energy i actually wrote about in a previous entry on kindness journals, which is wild because it means this experiment is proving its use by giving me a trail of my mental exploration.

In my concrete abode, a flare lighting the way out
The ephemeral promise draws me
like a firefly I seek my hopes.
The defeaning chorus of cicadas
consumes me in the darkness.
Out in the fields, the grains cultivated
What was promised eclipses the night
A permanent night light bathes me
as the swarm of stars engulfs me
from the infinite black canvas above</description></item></channel></rss>
