The beginning of the end but the start of something new&amp;hellip;
Wow, this is the 100th mini-essay, the final of the initial intent I started out with. To be honest, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure I would make it this far, and there were definitely moments of berating myself for committing myself publicly to this experiment. I got the seed of this idea from writing a little retro for my 24th birthday, reflecting on my 2021 theme of gambling and what direction I want to take my life and where I draw energy from.</description></item><item><title>quiet confidence</title><link>https://www.spencerchang.me/experiments/100posts/quiet-confidence/</link><pubDate>Wed, 29 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spencerchang.me/experiments/100posts/quiet-confidence/</guid><description>I watched this video today after showing up on my Youtube feed and started thinking about how to exude confidence with every ounce of your being. To me, confidence has always felt like a foreign attribute and skill that I need to actively work on. I naturally caveat and hurry through and self-deprecate to serve an artificial to avoid imposing and be looked upon favorable as &amp;ldquo;what a humble guy.&amp;rdquo; It means I&amp;rsquo;ve had to learn to force myself to be confident, even aiming to be arrogant or selfish in order to actually stand up for myself and assert my ground.</description></item><item><title>living to provoke</title><link>https://www.spencerchang.me/posts/living-to-provoke/</link><pubDate>Thu, 25 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spencerchang.me/posts/living-to-provoke/</guid><description>The other day, under the cover of dim lights embedded in elegant wooden fixtures, we took impassioned guesses at each other&amp;rsquo;s MBTI&amp;rsquo;s. Personality types are an interesting way we use to pretend to be in control of the world and knowing of the world&amp;rsquo;s secrets. We bucket each other into divisions of 16 and 9 and 25 and 12, assigning occupations and strengths, disposition and spirit animals. We tend to like hard divides because they give us the illusion of truth.</description></item><item><title>photography origin</title><link>https://www.spencerchang.me/experiments/100posts/photography-origin/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spencerchang.me/experiments/100posts/photography-origin/</guid><description>Today, I was finally getting around to wrapping up some of the editing on photos from my Alaska trip in September, and I wanted to reflect on and share my origin story for getting involved with photography.
My dad used to always carry around a handheld camcorder and a pocket-sized silver digital Canon. Any special occasion or family trip was accompanied by these portable, digital eyes. I constantly badgered my dad to let me use the small Canon.</description></item><item><title>soothing fire: a raging fire that cools</title><link>https://www.spencerchang.me/experiments/100posts/soothing-fire/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spencerchang.me/experiments/100posts/soothing-fire/</guid><description>I met up with jonah today for dinner since he was visiting the city, and we atlked about what we&amp;rsquo;ve been spending time on and the projects we&amp;rsquo;ve been working on. Jonah&amp;rsquo;s been spending time working at Bubble as well as deeply exploring the crypto space: investing, developing, and now learning how to audit. One thing I really admire about him is that he goes all in on things. You can tell almost off the bat that there&amp;rsquo;s this inner fire burning in him that compels him to act and contribute and push forward for the things that he cares about.</description></item><item><title>re: take back the future - the magic is ours</title><link>https://www.spencerchang.me/posts/take-back-the-future-response/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spencerchang.me/posts/take-back-the-future-response/</guid><description>In response to take back the future
In high school, I took a computer science class because I liked to play computer games. I never intended for it to become an outlet for expression, a STEM safe haven for my creative urges. I fell for the craft as much as I fell for the people and brands that were the face of it in society.
I&amp;rsquo;m heavily drawn to ideals, so nothing drew me more than the shining G, which had started to become the face of everyone&amp;rsquo;s experience with the internet.</description></item><item><title>Liminal Illusions</title><link>https://www.spencerchang.me/posts/liminal-illusions/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 Aug 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spencerchang.me/posts/liminal-illusions/</guid><description>This is a collage of several journals (composed at various levels of drunkenness) over the past weekend in Vegas, and my post-trip reflections from immersing myself in that environment.
Liminality is defined as the quality of transition between one destination and the next. It’s a state of being that feels unnatural because it’s meant to be temporary. Liminal states and places are defined only by their beginning and end—they have no meaning in absence of their composite destinations.</description></item><item><title>denim personality</title><link>https://www.spencerchang.me/posts/denim-personality/</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 Aug 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spencerchang.me/posts/denim-personality/</guid><description>I’ve been getting really into fashion lately. Perhaps my visit to New York was what really kicked it into overdrive for me given the opportunity to get inspiration everywhere you go on the street, but I’ve always been enamored with the idea of fashion and making yourself look good to feel good. As a child, I was bold with my choices. According to my dad who resurfaced an old journal entry recently, I once tried on some shoes in a store and refused to take them off because I was so enamored with them, and my parents ended up having to buy this nice pair of shoes for a 5-year-old (what a difficult child I must have been 😅).</description></item><item><title>the technology paradox</title><link>https://www.spencerchang.me/posts/technology-paradox/</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jul 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spencerchang.me/posts/technology-paradox/</guid><description>Under 280 in San Francisco during golden hour.
Yesterday, I made the trek down to Palo Alto for Alex&amp;rsquo;s birthday and had a great time in the afternoon barbecuing, laughing, and enjoying the South Bay summer. I was realizing it was the first time in the Bay where I&amp;rsquo;ve attended a large gathering that wasn&amp;rsquo;t predominantly people in the tech industry. Alex is a graduate student in physics at Stanford, so the party was full of PhD candidates and high school friends who&amp;rsquo;ve covered a spread across the different fields.</description></item><item><title>commitment and obligation</title><link>https://www.spencerchang.me/posts/commitment-and-obligation/</link><pubDate>Sun, 23 May 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spencerchang.me/posts/commitment-and-obligation/</guid><description>The first time I ran 3 miles was during a typical Houston summer, hot and humid. It was just past one, past the hottest time of day but still above 90, still hot enough to see the light shimmering in the liminal space between the planes where your eyes focused. I started cross country in middle school to follow my brother’s footsteps, and I kept with it because I figured it was a good way to keep myself fit.</description></item><item><title>craft over career</title><link>https://www.spencerchang.me/posts/craft-over-career/</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spencerchang.me/posts/craft-over-career/</guid><description>This post was originally published on my newsletter.

It’s a message from a classmate asking about my rooming plans for next semester with a not-so-subtle suggestion at a better option. I’m nearing the end of my first year in college, and having been successful at my quest to fit in, I’m tempted to change as little as possible to keep the good things going. The proposal to room with someone new (who I knew from the very intimate experience of recognizing their face across the dining hall every once in a while) was both an opportunity and a risk.</description></item><item><title>Dilution</title><link>https://www.spencerchang.me/posts/dilution/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Dec 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spencerchang.me/posts/dilution/</guid><description>Under my watchful eyes, a weight settles over the world. Thick layers of shadows pile on top of one another until all that’s left poking out in the sea of night are tiny fireflies, little torches signaling life. I look out my golden-ratioed window, a precise, technical masterpiece with a reinforced panel of glass acting as a projector for the production playing out beyond. In the distant horizon, the line where the sky meets the world and the galactic bend, glinting ever so inconspicuously, levels with my eyes.</description></item><item><title>Making the World a Better Place: A Valley of Smoke and Mirrors</title><link>https://www.spencerchang.me/posts/better-world-delusion/</link><pubDate>Sat, 26 Sep 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spencerchang.me/posts/better-world-delusion/</guid><description>a beach along Route 1 covered by the fog (photo credit spencerchang.photography)
To communicate an identity requires some degree of self-delusion. A performer, in order to be convincing, must conceal “the discreditable facts that he has had to learn about the performance; in everyday terms, there will be things he knows, or has known, that he will not be able to tell himself.” ー Trick Mirror: Reflections on Self-Delusion by Jia Tolentino summarizing Erving Goffman In second grade, we did an assignment on our dream jobs.</description></item><item><title>Making the “Right” Decisions</title><link>https://www.spencerchang.me/posts/right-decisions/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Jul 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spencerchang.me/posts/right-decisions/</guid><description>A mother and cub flourishing in the remains of a whaling station in Grytviken&amp;ndash;an example of something &amp;ldquo;right&amp;rdquo; becoming wrong.

Growing up, I strove to do all the “right” things. I was told that doing well in school was good, so I studied, toiled, and recited for good grades. I was told that being polite and obedient was proper, so I sucked up my protests and did what was demanded of me without question.</description></item><item><title>George Floyd</title><link>https://www.spencerchang.me/posts/george-floyd/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Jun 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spencerchang.me/posts/george-floyd/</guid><description>SF George Floyd Protest 06/03 for more see my instagram This week should have felt like another rude awakening for those of us who have rarely had to think about the problems in our criminal justice system and how our country handles protecting our communities.</description></item><item><title>Crowdsourced Birthday Recommendations</title><link>https://www.spencerchang.me/posts/crowdsourced-birthday-recs/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spencerchang.me/posts/crowdsourced-birthday-recs/</guid><description>I collected anonymous (or not) birthday recommendations and feedback.

“来吃饭了！(literally, &amp;lsquo;come eat!&amp;rsquo; but interpreted as &amp;lsquo;food&amp;rsquo;s ready!&amp;rsquo; )” rang through the hallways of my house, emanating from the kitchen. This was a daily occurrence, after a long day of school or work, signaling that dinner, which my 奶奶 (grandma) had lovingly prepared, was ready. Growing up in a Chinese American household, I was lucky to have my grandma live with us; this forced me to learn Mandarin from a young age because she couldn’t speak English.</description></item><item><title>From Student to Teacher</title><link>https://www.spencerchang.me/posts/student-to-teacher/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Sep 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spencerchang.me/posts/student-to-teacher/</guid><description>Photo by Mwesigwa Joel on Unsplash
”誰是我們的老師啊？(Who are our teachers?)“
“是我們 (We are)” I blurted.
Shit. We had just finished a whole week of training where we were specifically told to pretend not to know Chinese to encourage our students to speak English. And I had just responded in Chinese to their question. Great, first minute of “teaching” and I already messed up. How am I gonna survive 2 weeks of this?</description></item><item><title>Stupid Scholars, the Power of Hands, and Free Lunches: Riding Through 4 Years of University</title><link>https://www.spencerchang.me/posts/stupid-scholars/</link><pubDate>Sun, 02 Jun 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spencerchang.me/posts/stupid-scholars/</guid><description>“It’ll be fine,” I reassured myself for what seemed like the millionth time. The mere prospect of a roller coaster ride had reduced me to a broken record. I’ve never been a follower of the camp that derives thrill, much less joy, from artificial fear. Horror movies are a hard no, especially at night, alone in my room, and maybe it’s obvious, but I had never ridden a roller coaster.</description></item></channel></rss>
