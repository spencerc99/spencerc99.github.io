Jonah&amp;rsquo;s been spending time working at Bubble as well as deeply exploring the crypto space: investing, developing, and now learning how to audit. One thing I really admire about him is that he goes all in on things. You can tell almost off the bat that there&amp;rsquo;s this inner fire burning in him that compels him to act and contribute and push forward for the things that he cares about.</description></item></channel></rss>
